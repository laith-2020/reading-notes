* Password input Like a single line text box but it masks the characters entered.

* Text input (single-line) Used for a single line of text such as email addresses and names

 ## ``<form>``
### Form controls live inside a ``<form>`` element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too


**action**
 ### Every ``<form>`` element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.

**method**
Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The get method is ideal for:

``<input>``
## The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating

**width**
 to set the width of the table

**padding** ``to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content``

**text-transform** ``to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase``

**letter-spacing, font-size** ``to add additional styling to the content of the table headers``

**border-top, border-bottom** ``to set borders above and below the table headers``

**text-align** ``to align the writing to the left of some table cells and to the right of the others``

**background-color** ``to change the background color of the alternating table rows``
