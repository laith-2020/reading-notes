## Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that element’s children (which become Grid Items).

## display
Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

Values:

grid – generates a block-level grid
inline-grid – generates an inline-level grid

.container {
  display: grid | inline-grid;
}
