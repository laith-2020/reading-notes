## LinkS

**Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.**

## Writing Links


``Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute``

``<a>``
## ``Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.``



# Layout 

``Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.Block``

### containing ElEmEnts
## If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


## ControLLing the position of eLements
## CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property

* Normal Flow

## position static

**In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be:position: static**


* reLative positioning 

## position : relative

**Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.For example, you can move it 10 pixels lower than it would have been in normal flow or 20% to the right**


# WHAT IS A FUNCTION

## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

## declaration a function

### It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter). With call() , an object can use a method belonging to another object.


# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

## Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. What if you can could get all of this, instantaneously, while typing code line by line and character by character? You can, with pair programming, a technique common to many agile work environments.

# How does pair programming work?

## While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code


# Why pair program?


## While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful
