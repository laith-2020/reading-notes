### containing ElEmEnts If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation). The <div> element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.


Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
```<h1> <p> <ul> <li>```


Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
```<img> <b> <i>```

ControLLing the position of eLements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property
Normal Flow
position static
In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be:position: static

reLative positioning
position : relative
Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.For example, you can move it 10 pixels lower than it would have been in normal flow or 20% to the right

1. Normal flow
Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lowe
