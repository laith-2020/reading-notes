 ## BackgroUnd Images 

 The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

**repeat**

 The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

**repeat-x**

 The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).

**repeat-y**

 The image is repeated vertically only.

**no-repeat** 

The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:

**fixed** 

The background image stays in the same position on the page.

**scroll**

 The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed


### background-image

CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a different syntax.
