# Lists

``The ordered list is created with the <ol> element. <li>Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)``

* ``<ul>``

``The unordered list is created with the <ul> element. <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)``

## definitiOn Lists

* ``<dl>``

``The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.``

``Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements.``

``At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:

* Control the dimensions of your boxes
* Create borders around boxes
* Set margins and padding for boxes
* Show and hide boxes

Once you have learned how to control the appearance of each box, you will see how to position these boxes on your pages in Chapter 15 when we look at page layout``

# overfloWing  Content 

## The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:


<hr>

# If else

### In this example, the i f statement is checking if the value currently held in a variable called score is 50 or more.In this case, the statement evaluates to true (because the score is 75, which is greater than 50). Therefore, the contents of the statements within the subsequent code block are run, creating a message that congratulates the user and tells them to proceed.





# Swich Statment

### In this example, the purpose of the switch statement is to present the user with a different message depending on which level they are at. The message is stored in a variable called msg.The variable called l eve 1 contains a number indicating which level the user is on. This is then used as the switch value. (The switch value could also be an expression.

### USING FOR LOOPS :

#### A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.

### USING WHILE LOOPS: 

####  while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

### USING DO WHILE LOOPS  :

#### The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1e  loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
