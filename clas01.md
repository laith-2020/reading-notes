### In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen is in black <html> <body>  <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>  <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of     the page. And if the page is a long one it might     be split up into several sub-headings.<p>  <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>  <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help     you follow the structure of what is being written.     There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level     headings).</p>  <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>  <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p> </body> </html
